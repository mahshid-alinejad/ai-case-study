## Overview and Origin

* Amazon

* When was the company incorporated? 1994

* Who are the founders of the company?  Jeff Bezos

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos in July 1994. The idea for Amazon came about when Bezos, then a hedge fund executive in New York City, noticed the rapid growth of internet usage and realized the potential for e-commerce. Bezos was inspired by the statistic that internet usage was growing at 2,300% per year, and he saw an opportunity to create an online bookstore that could offer a wider selection of books than any physical store.

Bezos identified books as the perfect product to sell online due to their low unit price, universal demand, and the vast number of titles available. He believed that the internet could provide a platform for selling books more efficiently and cost-effectively than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.

In a car trip from New York City to Seattle, Bezos wrote the business plan for what would become Amazon. He chose Seattle as the location for the company because of its large pool of technical talent, particularly in computer science.

Bezos initially named the company "Cadabra" (short for "Abracadabra"), but he later changed it to "Amazon" after the Amazon River. Bezos wanted the name to evoke something "exotic and different" and to reflect the company's ambition to become the largest bookstore in the world.

From its humble beginnings as an online bookstore operating out of Bezos's garage, Amazon rapidly expanded its product offerings to include a wide range of goods, including electronics, clothing, and household items. Over the years, Amazon has continued to innovate and diversify its business, becoming one of the world's largest and most influential companies, with a significant presence in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? Amazon was initially funded by Jeff Bezos himself, who invested his own money to start the company. In 1994, Bezos raised an initial seed funding of $1 million from his family and friends to get Amazon off the ground.

In 1995, Amazon went public, raising $54 million through its initial public offering (IPO). The IPO marked a significant milestone for the company, providing it with additional capital to fuel its growth and expansion plans.

Since then, Amazon has primarily relied on its revenue generated from its operations to fund its growth and investments. The company's consistent profitability and strong cash flow have enabled it to finance its various ventures and initiatives without relying heavily on external funding.

Amazon has also occasionally raised additional capital through debt offerings or secondary stock offerings. However, these instances have been relatively infrequent compared to the company's reliance on its own revenue and cash reserves.

Amazon Forecast: Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service that uses ML to deliver highly accurate forecasts.
Companies today use everything from simple spreadsheets to complex financial planning software to attempt to accurately forecast future business outcomes such as product demand, resource needs, or financial performance. These tools build forecasts by looking at a historical series of data, which is called time series data. For example, such tools may try to predict the future sales of a raincoat by looking only at its previous sales data with the underlying assumption that the future is determined by the past. This approach can struggle to produce accurate forecasts for large sets of data that have irregular trends. Also, it fails to easily combine data series that change over time (such as price, discounts, web traffic, and number of employees) with relevant independent variables such as product features and store locations.
Based on the same technology used at Amazon.com, Amazon Forecast uses ML to combine time series data with additional variables to build forecasts. Amazon Forecast requires no ML experience to get started. You only need to provide historical data, plus any additional data that you believe may impact your forecasts. For example, the demand for a particular color of a shirt may change with the seasons and store location. This complex relationship is hard to determine on its own, but ML is ideally suited to recognize it. Once you provide your data, Amazon Forecast will automatically examine it, identify what is meaningful, and produce a forecasting model capable of making predictions that are up to 50% more accurate than looking at time series data alone.
Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service, so there are no servers to provision, and no ML models to build, train, or deploy. You pay only for what you use, and there are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.
Internet of Things (IoT): With products like Amazon Echo and Alexa-enabled devices, Amazon incorporates IoT technologies for smart home automation, voice recognition, and other applications.
These technologies provide a glimpse into Amazon's technological landscape, but it's essential to recognize that the company's technology stack evolves continuously as they innovate and adapt to new challenges and opportunities.
